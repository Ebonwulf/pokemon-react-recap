# React recap

A React recap using Pokemons! Again.

The aim is to build the previous Tech Test Pokemon page in React with some additional features.
Overall design, in three stages

- **Basic** - display the list of Pokemon characters, simplified, just the image and name, as a grid of cards.
- **Search** - adds a search box, with an optional fuzzy search
- **Detail** - added routes to allow a click through to a detail card
